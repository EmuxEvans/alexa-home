Alexa Schedules.

Allows you to schedule scenes.

Usage: "Alexa, schedule [scene name] scene [time]." e.g., "Alexa, schedule dinner scene at eight thirty tonight."

[Time] can either be specificed either relative to the current time ("Alexa, schedule dinner scene in 3 hours") or by specifying a time/date ("Alexa, schedule dinner scene tomorrow night at eight/next Wednesday morning at nine forty five.") Dates ("May twenty ninth") are not supported.

Your Hue lights will flash if the schedule has been successfully set. You can also check the Hue app to make sure the scene is scheduled. Schedules auto-delete after they are executed.
